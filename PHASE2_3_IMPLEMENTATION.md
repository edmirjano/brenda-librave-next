  // Popular books (by sales)
  popular: () => Book.findMany({ 
    orderBy: { orderItems: { _count: 'desc' } } 
  }),
  
  // Related books (same category/author)
  related: (bookId: string) => Book.findMany({
    where: { 
      OR: [
        { categoryId: book.categoryId },
        { author: book.author }
      ]
    }
  })
};
```

### Phase 3B: Brain.js Neural Networks (Week 2-3)
```typescript
const aiRecommendations = {
  // Train models on user interaction data
  trainCollaborativeFiltering: async () => {
    const interactions = await getUserInteractions();
    const trainingData = interactions.map(i => ({
      input: {
        userId: normalizeUserId(i.userId),
        bookId: normalizeBookId(i.bookId),
        rating: i.rating / 5,
        timeSpent: i.timeSpent / 1000
      },
      output: { purchased: i.purchased ? 1 : 0 }
    }));
    
    await collaborativeNet.trainAsync(trainingData);
  },
  
  // Generate personalized recommendations
  getRecommendations: async (userId: string) => {
    const scores = await Promise.all(
      allBooks.map(async (book) => {
        const score = collaborativeNet.run({
          userId: normalizeUserId(userId),
          bookId: normalizeBookId(book.id),
          rating: 0.8, // neutral
          timeSpent: 0.5 // average
        });
        
        return { book, score: score.purchased };
      })
    );
    
    return scores

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

### AI Model Training Schedule
- **Initial Training**: When 100+ users and 500+ interactions available
- **Retraining Schedule**: Weekly automatic retraining
- **Model Versioning**: Track model performance over time
- **Fallback Strategy**: Simple algorithms when AI fails

### Performance Monitoring
- **AI Response Times**: < 100ms for recommendation generation
- **Model Accuracy**: Track click-through and conversion rates
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU/memory usage for AI processing
- **User Experience**: Ensure AI enhances rather than slows down UX

### Privacy & Ethics
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary data for AI training
- **User Consent**: Clear consent for AI personalization
- **Algorithm Transparency**: Explain why recommendations are made
- **Bias Prevention**: Monitor for algorithmic bias in recommendations

This phased approach ensures each enhancement builds on proven foundations while maintaining focus on user value and business objectives.
